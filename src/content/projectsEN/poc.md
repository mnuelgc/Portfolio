resume: Augmented Reality Game to Introduce Primary and Secondary Students to Programming
stack: "{Unity}{C#}"
---

This game is developed using **Unity** to ensure cross-platform compatibility, making it accessible on both **Android** and **iOS** devices. The central idea is to use physical cards that students scan with their devices to control the character’s movements within the game, learning programming concepts in a fun and tangible way.

## Features

- **Interactive Game**: Students use physical cards to input commands, enhancing engagement and retention.
- **Cross-Platform**: Available on **Android** and **iOS** devices, leveraging **Unity's** cross-platform capabilities.
- **Augmented Reality**: Utilizes **AR** to blend physical and digital worlds, making learning more immersive.
- **Progressive Levels**: Includes nine levels with increasing difficulty to gradually introduce new programming concepts.
- **Educational Focus**: Specifically designed for primary and early secondary school students.

## Game Mechanics

**Game Start**: The main menu offers options to start in AR mode, non-AR mode, or exit the game.

**Board Placement**: In AR mode, players use their device’s camera to find a flat surface where they can place the game board.

**Gameplay**: Players use physical cards to command their character, scanning each card to visualize the action and confirm the movement.

From left to right, the current cards are displayed: Move Forward, Turn Left, and Turn Right. Then, the older versions follow, each one color-coded: red for Move Forward, blue for Turn Left, and green for Turn Right](/POC/cards.png "Cards")

**Level Progression**: As students advance, new cards and movements are introduced, increasing the complexity and educational value.
